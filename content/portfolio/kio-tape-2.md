Mine Valley is a spaceminer Like game, developed for Webgl and Yandex Games

The game features a grid of squares that hide either a mine or a safe spot. Your job is to reveal all the safe spots without detonating any of the mines. To do this, you can click on each square to reveal its contents. If you reveal a mine, the game is over.
